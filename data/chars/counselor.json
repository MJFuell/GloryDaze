    "long"  : "Well hello. I see people have been looking for me. That explains why it has been so quiet. But why are you still here? Oh, fell asleep in detention. And wandering around the school trying to find a way out. I'd help you but I'm busy looking for my cell phone.",
    "short" : "It sure is quiet here.  Sorry you've been so lost.  I'll help you get home once I find my cell phone.",
    "hint"  : "Thank you so much for helping me out! I used my key fob to unlock the principal's office for you.  Go see him and he'll let you out."
