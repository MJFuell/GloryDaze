    "name"  : "librarian",
    "desc"  : "You see a very tired person maybe due to all the books and magazines to put up who seems ready to take a break.",
    "long"  : "I am busy putting away this large cart of books and with my bad back it will take awhile. And I just put my AirPods in to jam to some music. I have to sit in silence all day, but after hours, I like to turn up the volume. Sorry I may be yelling, but my hands are full, and I cannot hear you. If you are here to go to the Gym, or to get a snack, or even to go to the bathroom, well, all of that is out the east door.",
    "short" : "My back is tied up in knots. Another long day ended by putting up hundreds of books. I wish I could PLAY some music. That would be even more relaxing than listening to music.",
    "hint"  : "Thanks for the music maker! What a nice instrument. I used to play one. Feel free to take a book."
