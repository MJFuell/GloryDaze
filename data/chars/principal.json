Normally everyone leaves exactly at 4pm - if not a few minutes early. So, the counselor said for me to check your backpack? Ok let me have a look. Hmmm, very interesting.",
    "short" : "The counselor was right to have me look at the items you found. I will put them in Lost and Found or return them myself. Let me make a quick phone call.",
    "hint"  : "Follow me to the front door. I called your parents. They are expecting you and are watching from your house right down the street! Go straight home, and have a good supper! They said it is still warm."
